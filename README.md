Group Project for 2022 - Big Scale Analytics

# Milestone 2

So far, the project is going well. We managed to deployed our app in the Google Cloud Console and we are currently improving the whole setup. 

Here are the different steps that we did:

1. We created a small  collab file to try to clean the data in order to improve the training of the model in point 2. 
2. We have successfully imported the data and trained the model in AutoML.
3. We configured Flask (adding all the addons cli numpy etc.)
4. We created a Python file (main.py) to set the parameters and connection to Flask and get the authentification of our API endpoint (method GET).
5. We create a HTML page (base.html) to give an output of the page (using jQuery library).
6. We deployed the app on Flask from the console (after having authentified in GCP if using local shell console).
